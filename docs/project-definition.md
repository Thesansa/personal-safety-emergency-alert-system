# Project Overview
## Background
The modern world has seen an increase in personal safety concerns due to social stress, emotional instability, and rising incidents of abuse and violence. Many individuals experience sudden dangerous situations in public spaces, often without prior warning or sufficient time to react.

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to support individuals in feeling safer during their daily activities by reducing the mental burden of constantly worrying about personal security. By providing a rapid emergency alert mechanism, the system allows users to focus on living peacefully while ensuring that help can be notified in case of an emergency.

## Real-World Relevance
With increasing awareness of personal safety risks and the presence of potential threats in public environments, there is a growing need for simple and reliable emergency alert solutions. This system addresses that need by enabling faster communication and response during critical situations.

## System Overview
The Personal Safety Emergency Alert System is a proposed application designed to assist individuals during dangerous situations by enabling rapid emergency communication...

# Project-statement
In sudden danger situations, individuals often lack the time or ability to seek help using conventional methods such as phone calls or manual messaging. Delays in alerting trusted contacts and the absence of automatic escalation when a victim becomes unresponsive can increase the risk of harm. This creates a need for a fast, reliable, and user-friendly emergency alert system that operates effectively under stress.

# Project Objectives
-To design a personal safety emergency alert system for dangerous situations
-To enable quick and simple SOS activation by users
-To provide real-time location sharing with trusted contacts
-To implement an automatic alert escalation mechanism when the user becomes unresponsive
-To support alert resolution through user cancellation or trusted contact acknowledgement
-To ensure secure handling and logging of emergency events throughout the alert lifecycle

# Project Scope
