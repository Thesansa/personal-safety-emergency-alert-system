# Technical Feasibility

The proposed system is technically feasible using existing and widely adopted technologies. 
Core functionalities such as SOS triggering, location tracking, notification delivery, and backend processing can be implemented using standard mobile/web frameworks, REST APIs, and relational databases.

The system does not require specialized hardware or proprietary platforms, making it suitable for development within an academic environment.
